        <h2>ColorStack</h2>
        <p> 
            At ColorStack, our core mission is to dismantle barriers to representation in the tech industry. 
            Conceived by Jehron Petty, who keenly observed the underrepresentation of Black and Latinx Computer Science students at Cornell, our organization is passionately committed to amplifying the presence of Black and Latinx CS graduates in the realm of rewarding technical careers. 
            Rooted in our unwavering dedication to diversity and inclusion, we paint a vision of a future where Black and Latinx technologists lead the charge in driving innovation. 
            Personally, this journey has allowed me to connect with a vibrant community, fostering countless valuable relationships and providing opportunities to meet potential mentors who have profoundly influenced my career path. 
            Within our network, a spirit of mutual support thrives, where shared advice becomes a guiding force propelling each of us forward in our professional journeys. 
            It's a collaborative ecosystem where collective wisdom propels us toward success, reinforcing our commitment to creating a tech landscape that truly reflects the richness of human diversity.
