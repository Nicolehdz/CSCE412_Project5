            These are some of my most relevant projects I have completed or am in the process:
        </p>
        <h2>CYPSA</h2>
        <p> 
            Project is centered on optimizing threat detection and monitoring through intuitive graphical representations of network activities. 
            This initiative seeks to streamline risk assessment and compliance efforts by presenting vulnerabilities and potential threats in a more accessible manner. 
            Leveraging the RESLab Testbed and CyPRES EMS, the project aims to integrate FMECA and a Risk Matrix, enhancing its capability to spot flaws in machinery and systems and prioritize cybersecurity risks. 
            The ongoing work aims to create a holistic solution that combines data acquisition, cyber attack simulation, data fusion algorithms, and a user-friendly CyPSA interface for improved cybersecurity measures.

        <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe CLI Expert</h2>
        <p> 

            Tackled a coding challenge, crafting an engaging command line interface (CLI) game in under 24 hours. 
            The project aimed to provide users, regardless of their backgrounds, with an interactive experience. Specifically, 
            I designed a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game, incorporating NPM packages to enhance accessibility and enjoyment.
            In the same timeframe, I built a CLI-based coding project and presented it to Capital One Software Engineers and Managers. 
            This experience not only showcased my proficiency in Node.js but also allowed me to gather insights from industry professionals. 
            Additionally, I independently developed a program as part of a Capital One program, highlighting my commitment to continuous learning and hands-on application of my coding skills.

        <h2>8alance</h2>
        <p> 
            I collaborated with a group of three individuals, including myself, to develop a unique app aimed at promoting self-care and raising social awareness. 
            Our creation, "8alance," is a mental health app designed to offer users valuable resources. 
            Notably, the app incorporates an engaging 8-ball game that not only entertains but also delivers personalized self-care activities.
            In particular, my responsibility within the team was to craft the 8-ball shaker simulation, a crucial component that enhances user interaction with the app. 
            Through this feature, users can thoroughly engage with the app, ensuring a dynamic and immersive experience. The 8alance app represents our collective effort to contribute 
            positively to mental well-being by combining entertainment with self-care resources.
