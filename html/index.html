        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Nicole Hernandez, a Latina first-generation student at Texas A&M University, 
            where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and a Minor in Mathematics. 
            Most of all I am passionate about using my knowledge to build innovative solutions and am eager to expand my technical skill set. 
            I'm always looking for ways to learn and improve, and I think that every step I take on the route of becoming a computer engineer 
            has a lot of potential to help me grow both personally and professionally.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p> 
            In the dynamic tech world, staying on top of things is key. I'm all about continuous learning, not to be ahead of the game, but to stay in the loop with the latest in computer engineering. 
            This means checking out workshops, and possibly obtaining a few certifications along the way. 
            It's less about being on a pedestal and more about staying grounded in the tech field.
        </p>
        <p>
            Community is everything to me. I'm on a quest to build a supportive network, seeking mentors who can offer guidance in my career. But it's not just about what I can gain, 
            I'm eager to join mentorship programs to uplift fellow Latina engineers. Networking isn't a checkbox for me; 
            it's about genuine connections, both inside and outside my workplace, to share ideas and spark collaborations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Diversity and inclusion are at the core of my values. I'm genuinely passionate about creating an environment where everyone can thrive. 
            My commitment extends beyond personal growth, I want to actively participate in initiatives that encourage more women, especially Latina women, and underrepresented minorities to explore and excel in the world of computer engineering. 
            This means rolling up my sleeves to advocate for inclusive hiring practices and workplace policies.

        <h2>Why Engineering?</h2>
        <p> 
            Taking on a personal project to improve electronic health records (EHRs) interoperability, 
            I dove into in-depth research and teamed up with a medical professional to grasp the industry's challenges. 
            Pitching inventive solutions, I immersed myself in software engineering, crafting prototypes to tackle the identified issues. 
            This hands-on journey exposed me to the incredible impact technology can have on healthcare, 
            igniting a genuine passion to use my computer engineering skills for positive change. 
            This project became a turning point, solidifying my dedication to a career where 
            I can contribute to significant progress where technology meets healthcare.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p> 
            I've got a couple of passions that keep me on my toes and help me unwind. 
            I really enjoy dancingâ€”it's my go-to for letting loose and having a great time. And, on the flip side, I've got this thing for fashion. 
            Exploring styles and expressing myself through clothing is just my kind of creative outlet. 
            It's funny how a good dance session and finding the perfect outfit can lift your spirits, you know?
